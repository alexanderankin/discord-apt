Discord APT repository
==

As has been [repeatedly asked for](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360031737491-Give-us-an-apt-repository-Linux-), this is an APT repository for Discord. Note that I do not in anyway claim ownership over the .deb files here, this is just merely a nicer packaging option. Discord: if you want to do this yourself, please tell me about it and I'll point people there instead!

Note that as a result the `LICENSE` herein explicitly does _not_ apply to the files in `debian/pool` as those belong to Discord, but it does apply to everything else.

Usage instructions
--
1. Create a file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/discord.list` with the contents `deb https://palfrey.github.io/discord-apt/debian/ ./`
    1. Optionally, limit this repo to your archiecture: `deb [arch=amd64] ...`
    2. Optionally, specify an explicit key file for verifying the packages: `deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/...] ...`
2. Download the file https://palfrey.github.io/discord-apt/discord-apt.gpg.asc to `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d`
    1. Optionally, `gpg --dearmor` the file to convert it to the format `apt` prefers if your apt requires it: `cat input.gpg | gpg --dearmor > output.gpg ; mv output.gpg input.gpg`
    2. If you specified a `signed-by` option in step 1, make sure the file location matches that value.
3. `sudo apt-get update`
4. `sudo apt-get install discord`

Commands:

```shell
curl -fSsL https://palfrey.github.io/discord-apt/discord-apt.gpg.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/discord-apt.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg-architecture -q DEB_HOST_ARCH) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/discord-apt.gpg] https://palfrey.github.io/discord-apt/debian/ ./" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/discord.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install discord -y
```

Manual update instructions
--
This should not be needed, as `.github/workflows/update.yml` should do this, but just in case..

1. This repo contains some large files, so install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) before checking out the repo.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python get_new_package.py`
    - If this says `already have discord-<version>.deb` and there's no new .debs in the repo, there's nothing to do further.
4. `export KEY_PASSPHRASE=<key phrase for the Discord Apt Repository key>`
5. `make debian/Release.gpg`, which should regenerate all the other files.
6. Commit, push, etc and the Github Pages automation will deal with the rest.
